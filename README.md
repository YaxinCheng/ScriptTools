# ScriptTools
A collection repo for all script tools I built
All scripts should be stored in the same repository
No newer repository should be open

## CSCI2110MarkingScript
### Used for CSCI 2110 assignments marking. Handles some easy checking tasks
Served from September, 2016 to December 2016 when I was the TA of CSCI 2110 Computer Science III.

### Checking for existance of a specific course in a specific faculty at terms, and even a specific page on Dal Academic Timetable
